 Web app to update a nuxt blog repository on Github.
 The app is compatable with the blog, git@github.com:duanemcguire/duaneblog.git
   and others that I have put together with nuxt.
 When the nuxt blog repository  is linked to netlify deploy, this app opens
   admin to the non-techie and the lazy techie.
